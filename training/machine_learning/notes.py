#? Machine Learning: [Work with structure data]
#*  is a discipline o fcomputer science theat uses computer algorithms and analytics to build predictive models that can solve proplems.
#*  is  based on algorithms that can learn from data without relying on rule-based programming.
#       Data => Learns from past data => output.

#
#? Deep learning: [Work with structure and unstructure data]
#*  is a subset of machine learning that deals with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
#*  Can work with and enormous amount of both structured and unstructured data.
#*  the major difference between DL and ML is the way data is presented to the machine.
#       input . . . . => angorithm . . . . => output . . . .
#       each dot in input is a data, each data will connect with each dot in algorithm, the same to output.
#*  work with alot of dataset.

#               binary: tow things.
#               multi.
#               #! Lable: cat, dog.
#               #! Classification: cat, cats, dog, dogs ==> 0, 1, 2, 3. || cant't change the number, can't do any operation on them.
#           - Recognition. [Numbers]
#               #! continuos data => data extract from data ==> the weight of a cat, the wight of a dog || If i do an poereation between them it will mean something
#*       Unupervised Learning:
#        I don't thell it the lables the AI will lable it.

#? Supervised Learning:
#   when do the algorithm and learn then have a data from a data set ==> modle.
#? Unsupervised Learining
# Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reducion.
# input raw data => Interpretation: unknown output => Algorithm => Processing => output
#? reinforcement Learning
# interacts with environment and learn from them based on #! rewards 
# Action => env => Reward.
